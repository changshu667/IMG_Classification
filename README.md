# Motivation
This Project attempts to detect solar PV panels from overhead satellite inmages.

Climate Change is global concern that requires a global commitment and solution. Countries from Italy to Vanuatu to the United States are already facing the economic and political weight of rising tides and less fertile farmlands. As these occurrences continue to increase, investment into clean and scalable energy solutions becomes extremely necessary. As such, being able to rapidly identify between locations with solar PV panels and those without allow for numerous beneficial applications, from being able to distinguish areas which have minimal carbon footprints, to ideal locations for expansion or green technologies, to identifying avenues of potential political and economic issues subverting the use of these technologies.

# Data
1500 training images as well as the 1500 test images. 
These images are all overhead satellite views of suburban and residential locations. Each image is 101 pixels in width and 101 pixels in height. They are all color images utilizing the RBG (Red-Blue-Green) color channels.
